# Site Reliability Engineering Challenge
 
## Purpose
The purpose of this challenge is to help us understand if you have a base level of coding/scripting skills. It will also serve as a starting point for our discussion during the interview.

## Task 
Dedicate up to an hour and a half to complete this project before the interview.  You will be judged based on following good development flow(branching/forking,regular working commits, and MR), and based on if what you submit actually works. 
Here is what we want you to create.  
* Create IaC that  
  - Spins up a new EC2 Instance in AWS based on the latest Windows Server 2019 AMI  
  - Installs IIS  
  - Deploys the index.html file in the root of this repo to IIS and has IIS serve it
* Modify the index.html file so that it can accept user input and display it on the page
 
## Impress Us
If this is too simple a task add something to the project that shows off your skills.  
Some ideas include:
* Monitoring(Preferably DataDog), Testing using Terratest 
* HA
* Auto Scaling
* A Source Controlled Development Environment
